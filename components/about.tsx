          <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
            As a masters graduate in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University, I'm passionate about
            leveraging cutting-edge technologies in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence to solve
            complex real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
            With a strong foundation in both technical skills and practical applications, I've had the opportunity to
            work on diverse projects ranging from AI-powered document processing to advanced cybersecurity analytics. My

            I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI and business, where I can apply my skills to drive
            innovation and create value. Whether it's developing intelligent chatbots, optimizing data extraction
            processes, or building recommendation systems, I'm always eager to take on new challenges and push the
            boundaries of what's possible with AI and data science.

            When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you can find me exploring the latest developments in AI,
            participating in hackathons, or contributing to open-source projects. I'm always looking for opportunities
            to collaborate on exciting projects and learn from fellow professionals in the field.
